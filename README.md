# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
In this project, I will assume that I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm, known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants. The company wants to stay up-to-date with new technologies and identify the skills that will be most important in the future.

As a Data Analyst, my role is to help with this by collecting data from multiple sources such as job postings, training websites, and surveys. Once enough data is collected, I will analyze it to find trends, patterns, and insights about the most in-demand programming skills.

The goal of this project is to create a clear report on emerging skills that can help the company plan for future training and hiring needs. Each step of the data analysis process is presented in separate notebooks in this repository, along with some additional files to make it easier to understand the project and follow the workflow.
